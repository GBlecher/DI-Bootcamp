# Part 1 : Quizz :
# Answer the following questions

# 1.What is a class?
# 2.What is an instance?
# 3.What is encapsulation?
# 4.What is abstraction?
# 5.What is inheritance?
# 6.What is multiple inheritance?
# 7.What is polymorphism?
# 8.What is method resolution order or MRO?


# ANSWERS:

# 1.  A class could be considered a template of sorts that is used to create objects in its image. 
#     They define the attributes and methods that the object can use.
# 2.  An instance is also known as an object is the product of the class.
#     when you create an instance you initiate that class.
# 3. encapsulation is when you restrict access to certain attributes ,
#    usually, inorder to protect it from being altered or even seen by those who shouldnt be doing so.
#    in other words you make them "private"
# 4. abstractin is when you hide complex code(the behinfd the scenes)exposing only relevant 
#    components needed to use the the code. like when you use an app you only se the interface,
#  but behind the scenes there is plenty of code that you dont nbeed or want to be exposed to
# 5. Inheretance is when you allow one class (child or sub class) to get(inherit) its attributes and methods 
#    form another(parent or super class). for example you might have an Animal class you can create a subclass,
#    called Dog and/or Cat which will inherit its attributes from Animal, so that you dont have to do it for each sub class 
# 6. It is when you can inheret different attributes and methods from multiple super classes 
# 7. It is when you can treat different classes as instances of the same class. 
#    Meaning you could use a single method or function
# 8. It is the order in which python looks for a method or atribute.
#    it creates a hierarchy classes ,attributes and methods. it determines the sequence of checks that python preforms
